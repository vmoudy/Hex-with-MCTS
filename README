Here is assignment 4. Made a hex board and would randomly fill untillit was full.
when it fills, it then finds a winner. sometimes red, sometimes blue because these
 two players are not playing optimally since they are randomized. the code is pretty 
generic so if you want, you can have a 13x13 or 5x5. all you have to do is change the 
size in the constructor and the code in the hex_game.cpp, change the random num generator 
from 1 to whatever the size is, so 5 or 11 or 13. i tried to generalize that too 
but was running into problems like infinite loops. but it should be just fine for 
11x11. cheers!
